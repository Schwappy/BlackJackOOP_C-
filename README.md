# BlackJackOOP_CPP
New programmer's First Program!

Intro: **********************************
This is my first foray into Github, 
I'm sure there's a lot of things I will be misusing and/or overlooking 
(especially in this first README.md)

This Repo is almost my first ever fully functioning program written in C++.  
I'm a brand new progrmmer (second semester) less than 10 months of coding 
experience (from learning what a variable is to now).  

With that aside, let's get to what this Repo is all about.

synopsis: **********************************
Paul's my name and Black Jack's my game!

This is a console (test) based Black Jack game.
I like to think of it as being failry robust for a new programmer.

As for features:
1) It's single player (this could be changed - but I'd wait until a GUI is done for that)
2) The user can select up to 8 decks of cards to use.
3) Hand functions are Stand, hit, split, and double down
4) Insurance in case the Dealer shows an Ace after hand is dealt
5) and other standard Black Jack things!

Motivation: **********************************
I wrote this program as a semester project for my Intermediate C++ class

I landed on Black Jack because I had a very simple version written in Python
and I wanted to expand it and see how rewriting code worked.

With the idea of this being a school project, there are a couple things that 
were required to be included (operator overloads mainly).

These are sloppy in there use, not necessarily in their implementation, but 
I'm sure they could be handled in a better way - as with much of my code, 
there has to be more efficient ways of writing this program, and I'd love to 
see what you out there can do with it!  


Future hopes: **************************************
I'd like to write a GUI version based on this code, but as I am still new 
to this whole world of programming, I'm not sure what the best GUI to use is.

I'm looking into QT or MFC(through Visual Studio).

I'd also like to fix teh system(Pause"); code at the end of my main() function
since I know that's taboo to use.
